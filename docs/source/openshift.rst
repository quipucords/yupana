Working with OpenShift
======================

We are currently developing using OpenShift version 3.9. There are different setup requirements for Mac OS and Linux (instructions are provided for Fedora). To install the openshift client, visit https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/ver=3.9/rhel---7/3.9.43/x86_64/product-software and follow the instructions to download the oc archive. Once you have downloaded the archive, unpack it and move the oc binary to a location such as ``/Users/your-user/dev/bin/openshift/``. Now edit your .bash_profile to define ``PATH`` as the following::

    PATH="PATH_TO_OPENSHIFT_OC/:${PATH}"
    export PATH

Restart your shell. Run ``oc cluster up`` once before running the make commands to generate the referenced config file.

Setup Requirements for Mac OS
-----------------------------

There is a known issue with Docker for Mac ignoring `NO_PROXY` settings which are required for OpenShift. (https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/18596) The current solution is to use a version of Docker prior to 17.12.0-ce, the most recent of which can be found at `docker-community-edition-17091-ce-mac42-2017-12-11`_

Docker needs to be configured for OpenShift. A local registry and proxy are used by OpenShift and Docker needs to be made aware.

Add `172.30.0.0/16` to the Docker insecure registries which can be accomplished from Docker -> Preferences -> Daemon. This article details information about insecure registries `Test an insecure registry | Docker Documentation`_

Add `172.30.1.1` to the list of proxies to bypass. This can be found at Docker -> Preferences -> Proxies

Running Locally in OpenShift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start the local cluster run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    make oc-up

That will start a barebones OpenShift cluster that will persist configuration between restarts. Once the cluster is running, you can deploy Yupana and PostgreSQL by running the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    make oc-create-yupana

If you'd like to start the cluster, deploy Yupana, and deploy PostgreSQL, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    make oc-up-dev

To stop the local cluster run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    make oc-down

Since all cluster information is preserved, you are then able to start the cluster back up with ``make oc-up`` and resume right where you have left off.

If you'd like to remove all your saved settings for your cluster, you can run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    make oc-clean

There are also other make targets available to step through the project deployment. You can run the entire application and its dependent services through Openshift, or just the dependent services can be spun up, while using the local Django dev server.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Run everything through Openshift
    make oc-up-all

    # Run just a database in Openshift, while running the server locally
    make oc-up-db

    # Run Django migrations to initialize the database
    make oc-server-migrate

    # Run the Django server locally with access to the OpenShift database
    make serve-with-oc

    # Run a build with updated template changes
    make oc-update-template

Fedora
------

The setup process for Fedora is well outlined in two articles.
First, get Docker up and running. `Getting Started with Docker on Fedora`_.

Then follow these instructions to get OpenShift setup `OpenShift — Fedora Developer Portal`_.

Troubleshooting
---------------

OpenShift uses Docker to run containers. When running a cluster locally for developement, deployment can be strained by low resource allowances in Docker. For development it is recommended that Docker have at least 4 GB of memory available for use.

Also, if Openshift services misbehave or do not deploy properly, it can be useful to spin the cluster down, restart the Docker service and retry.
